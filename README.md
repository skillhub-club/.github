## 💡 What is SkillHub?

SkillHub bridges the gap between raw AI potential and project-specific mastery. We provide a standardized infrastructure for "Skills"—a combination of context rules, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and project instructions—allowing your AI Agent to work with the precision of a senior engineer.

### Key Pillars:

* **Contextual Intelligence**: Tailored rules for specific frameworks (Next.js, Rust, Tailwind, etc.).
* **Tool Augmentation**: Integration with [MCP Servers](https://github.com/skillhub-club/mcp-server) to give agents real-world capabilities.
* **Universal Compatibility**: Write a skill once and deploy it across any supported IDE or Agent.
